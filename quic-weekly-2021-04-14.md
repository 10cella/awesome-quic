> **QUIC** is the Quick UDP Internet Connections protocol, developed by Google and currently in IETF workgroups for further development. It is being considered for replacing TCP as a transport protocol for HTTP/3. We are building an Open source project for IoT & Edge Computing atop QUIC called ü¶ñ[YoMo](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo/)

## QUIC Weekly - 20210414

* [@Daniel Stenberg](https://twitter.com/bagder) 's blog: WHERE IS HTTP/3 RIGHT NOW?, said the specifications are all done. They‚Äôre now waiting in queues to get their final edits and approvals before they will get assigned RFC numbers and get published as such ‚Äì they will not change any further.
* netray.io scans the IPv4 address space weekly and checks how many hosts that speak QUIC. Their latest scan found 2.1 million such hosts.

* All the major browsers have HTTP/3 implementations and most of them allow you to manually enable it if it isn‚Äôt already done so. Chrome and Edge have it enabled by default and Firefox will so very soon
