> **QUIC** is the Quick UDP Internet Connections protocol, developed by Google and currently in IETF workgroups for further development. It is being considered for replacing TCP as a transport protocol for HTTP/3. We are building an Open source project for IoT & Edge Computing atop QUIC called ü¶ñ[YoMo](https://yomo.run/)

## QUIC Weekly - 20210106

* [WebTransport](https://w3c.github.io/webtransport/) This specification uses pluggable protocols, with QUIC [QUIC-TRANSPORT] as one such protocol, to send data to and receive data from servers. It can be used like WebSockets but with support for multiple streams, unidirectional streams, out-of-order delivery, and reliable as well as unreliable transport.
