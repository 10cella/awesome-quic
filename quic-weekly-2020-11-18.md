> **QUIC** is the Quick UDP Internet Connections protocol, developed by Google and currently in IETF workgroups for further development. It is being considered for replacing TCP as a transport protocol for HTTP/3. We are building an Open source project for IoT & Edge Computing atop QUIC called ü¶ñ[YoMo](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo/)

* üìΩ Throwback to [QUIC BoF session in July 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGvFuvmEufs). A Working Group forming meeting to decide if QUIC should be adopted for standardisation into the IETF, based on the exissting deployment experience of Google.
* üìΩ Robin Marx [gave a keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuSpghHP0uI&feature=youtu.be) at IEEE LATINCOM about his experiences doing a PhD on the QUIC and HTTP3 protocols. He talked about their basic features, open research questions and his process in contributing the qlog and qvis debugging tools.
* [lsquic release 2.24.4](https://github.com/litespeedtech/lsquic), contains fixes to congestion controller and to CID lifecycle.
* [iOS 14 and macOS Big Sur include an experimental preview of HTTP/3 support](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10111/?time=701) for your apps that use URLSession, which you can enable in developer settings. To enable HTTP/3 macOS Big Sur: `defaults write -g CFNetworkHTTP3Override -int 3`.
