**QUIC** is the Quick UDP Internet Connections protocol, developed by Google and currently in IETF workgroups for further development. It is being considered for replacing TCP as a transport protocol for HTTP/3. We are building an Open source project for IoT & Edge Computing atop QUIC called ü¶ñ[YoMo](https://yomo.run/)
